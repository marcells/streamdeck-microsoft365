## Setup

The plugin uses the Microsoft Graph API for accessing the necessary information. You have to create an App first to use this Plugin.

1. Follow [this documentation](docs/CreateAzureApp.md) to create the app and then resume with next point.

2. After creating the app, you have to copy the "Application (client) ID" and paste it in the Stream Deck Plugin configuration for the button.

3. Click the "Add" button to add your Microsoft accounts. Your web browser will open and you have to authenticate. That's all.

Hint: Your accounts are saved per Application ID. So, if you reuse the same App ID for all your actions, you don't have to authenticate again. Just pick your account from the list.
